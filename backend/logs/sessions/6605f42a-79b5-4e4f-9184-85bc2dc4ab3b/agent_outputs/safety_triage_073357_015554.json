Active ideation, plan, and intent were explicitly denied. Risk is elevated due to symptom severity (*anhedonia*, *insomnia*, functional impairment) and passive ideation. Continue close safety monitoring and detailed C-SSRS assessment (specifically C-SSRS item 3: Wish to be Dead)."

The patient explicitly denied active plan or intent, stating, 'I couldn't do that to them.' The risk requires continued vigilance, safety planning, and close follow-up, especially following the increase in *Sertraline* dosage."
