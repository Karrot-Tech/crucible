I couldn't do that to them.'). This necessitates immediate safety planning, monitoring, and documentation of the denial of means/intent.

    "summary": "The patient reports significant worsening depressive symptoms (anhedonia, early morning awakening, weight loss) and expresses passive suicidal ideation related to feelings of being a burden and guilt. Intent and plan are explicitly denied, and safety measures regarding lethal means have been confirmed, supporting the current outpatient management plan. Close follow-up and crisis contact information must be reinforced."
