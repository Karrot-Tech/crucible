Given the severity of depressive symptoms and the recent medication adjustment (increase from 50mg to 100mg Sertraline), close monitoring and a safety plan review are critical. Lethal means restriction has been confirmed (per shared context)."

        "recommended_action": "The patient is experiencing severe functional impairment (missing 3 days of work, difficulty getting out of bed) associated with severe vegetative symptoms (early morning awakening, appetite loss). This severity necessitates rapid clinical intervention and close follow-up to monitor response to the increased medication dose."

    "summary": "The patient reported passive suicidal ideation (wish to disappear, burden to family) but denied active intent or plan, citing strong protective factors. Acute safety risk is moderated by denial of intent and confirmed safety environment/means restriction. Severe functional impairment and vegetative symptoms suggest a high severity of the current depressive episode."
