I couldn't do that to them.'). Protective factors (family) are intact. Based on the assumption that immediate means restriction and environment safety were confirmed by the provider (as per shared transcript), the risk is monitored closely on an outpatient basis. Documentation of a formal safety plan and crisis numbers is mandatory."

Based on the provider's prior confirmation of a safe environment and lack of access to lethal means, the risk is categorized as moderate, requiring vigilant monitoring and safety planning, but not immediate escalation to a higher level of care."
