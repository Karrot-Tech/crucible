    "reasoning": "The session is a scheduled follow-up focused on reviewing the patient's severe symptom presentation (anhedonia, early morning awakening, significant guilt) four weeks post-initiation of Sertraline. The discussion included standard safety triage regarding passive suicidal ideation, which was determined to be negative for active plan/intent, and led directly to a justified medication change (Sertraline dose increase)."
