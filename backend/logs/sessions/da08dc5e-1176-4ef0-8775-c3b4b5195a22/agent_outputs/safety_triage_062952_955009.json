Initiate structured safety planning, confirm and document absence of lethal means (as requested in the clarification), and schedule a prompt follow-up appointment (within 1-2 weeks) given the acute symptom severity and medication dosage increase."

    "summary": "The patient reports significant worsening of depressive symptoms (fatigue, early morning awakening, weight loss, severe guilt) and passive suicidal ideation (wishing to disappear, feeling family would be better off). Intent and plan were denied. A moderate, non-imminent suicide risk is present, necessitating formal safety planning and verification of means restriction."
