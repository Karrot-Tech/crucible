      "reasoning": "The session is a scheduled follow-up focused on reviewing the patient's severe symptom presentation (anhedonia, early morning awakening, significant guilt) four weeks post-initiation of Sertraline. The discussion included standard safety triage regarding passive suicidal ideation, which was determined to be negative for active plan/intent, and led directly to a justified medication change (Sertraline dose increase)."

While the patient explicitly denies intent, plan, or preparatory behaviors and notes strong protective factors ('I couldn't do that to them'), the risk level requires immediate safety planning documentation, confirmation of means restriction, and close follow-up, especially initiating an antidepressant dose increase."
