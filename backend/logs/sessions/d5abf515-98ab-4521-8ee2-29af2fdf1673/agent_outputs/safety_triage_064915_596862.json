    "summary": "The patient reports significant functional decline (*missing work*), severe vegetative symptoms (*early morning awakening*, *weight loss*), and passive suicidal ideation (wishing to *disappear*). Active suicidal intent is denied. The risk is considered **MODERATE** due to the severity of the depressive episode and the presence of ideation, but is mitigated by the denial of intent and confirmed restriction of lethal means."
