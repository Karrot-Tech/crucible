However, the presence of passive suicidal ideation and the proposed increase in *Sertraline* dose (50mg to 100mg) necessitates careful monitoring for activation or increased ideation in the coming weeks. Safety planning should be reinforced."

Active ideation, intent, and plan are denied by the patient, and access to lethal means is confirmed restricted. Outpatient safety management is appropriate. The team must monitor closely following the *Sertraline* dose adjustment."
