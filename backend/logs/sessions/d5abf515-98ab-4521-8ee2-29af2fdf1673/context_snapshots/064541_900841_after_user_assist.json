      "clinical_nature": "follow-up",
      "validation_result": "approved",
      "reasoning": "The patient reports classic symptoms of severe, escalating depression (terminal insomnia, anhedonia, weight loss) despite being on 50mg of Sertraline for 4 weeks. Safety screening confirms passive death ideation only. The focus of the session is medication management (increasing Sertraline to 100mg) and brief behavioral activation."
