Safety screening confirms passive death ideation only. The focus of the session is medication management (increasing Sertraline to 100mg) and brief behavioral activation."

Active suicidal intent and plan are denied, and the patient cites protective factors (family). This constitutes a **Moderate** suicide risk requiring formal safety planning and enhanced follow-up, particularly after the medication dosage change."
