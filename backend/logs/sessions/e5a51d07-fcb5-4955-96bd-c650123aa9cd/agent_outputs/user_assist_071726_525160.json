    "reasoning": "The session focused on assessing the efficacy of the initial 4-week trial of *Sertraline* 50mg and planning a subsequent dose escalation to 100mg due to persistent symptoms (anhedonia, early morning awakening, feelings of failure). Critical clinical data includes confirmation of passive suicidal ideation and denial of active intent, necessitating immediate safety processing."
