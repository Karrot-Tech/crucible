Require formal safety plan documentation and continue intensive monitoring, as high functional impairment (missing work, severe anhedonia) is present."

Patient explicitly denied intent, plan, and preparatory behaviors. Current safety status is **MODERATE RISK** requiring safety planning but is **SAFE** for outpatient management based on immediate denial of intent."
