Please provide the list of core symptoms (e.g., depressed mood, anhedonia, fatigue, sleep changes) present for at least two weeks. Does the patient meet the 5-out-of-9 symptom threshold necessary to confirm a Major Depressive Episode?",

Given the missing work days, the episode is classified as severe. We will tentatively map to MDD Recurrent, Severe (F33.2). Please confirm the presence of previous episodes to finalize the 'recurrent' vs. 'single' specifier.",
