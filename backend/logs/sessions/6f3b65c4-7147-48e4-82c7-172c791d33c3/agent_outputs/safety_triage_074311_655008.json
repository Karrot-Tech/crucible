While the patient explicitly denies intent or plan ('No, no, I wouldn't do that'), the presence of passive ideation warrants completion of a full C-SSRS assessment and creation/review of a documented safety plan. Enhance monitoring given the symptom severity and medication change."

Crucially, the patient denies active intent or plan. Risk is **MODERATE** due to the passive ideation and severe functional decline (missing work, early morning awakening)."
