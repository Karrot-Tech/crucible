      "reasoning": "The session is a standard psychiatric follow-up focusing on tracking the course of an acute depressive episode. The clinical dialog includes necessary safety assessment (C-SSRS components) and therapeutic medication management (SSRI dose increase) in response to reported treatment failure at the current dose."

This requires immediate formal C-SSRS assessment (to be handled by Risk Assessment Agent) and integration of safety planning into the treatment plan."
