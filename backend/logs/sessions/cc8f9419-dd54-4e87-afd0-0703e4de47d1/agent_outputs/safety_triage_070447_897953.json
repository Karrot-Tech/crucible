The patient identified protective factors ('I couldn't do that to them'). Given the severity of *depressive symptoms* (anhedonia, *early morning awakening*, *guilt*, functional impairment) and the *medication change* (Sertraline increase), the risk remains moderate. Enhanced safety plan review and close follow-up are required."
