Conduct a full C-SSRS (Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale) assessment to definitively rule out intent, plan, and preparatory behaviors. Institute safety planning and increase monitoring due to the severity of vegetative and cognitive symptoms (anhedonia, worthlessness, functional impairment, insomnia)."
