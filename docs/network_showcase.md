# 🌐 Crucible Network Showcase

**Crucible** is powered by a high-frequency, event-driven neural mesh of specialized psychiatric agents. This showcase demonstrates the system in active collaboration.

## 🧠 Neural Mesh in Motion
The heart of Crucible is the **Agent Neural Mesh**. It visualizes real-time synapses between the **Administrator** and active agents. Highlights indicate data transfer and "thinking" states.

## 💬 Autonomous Collaboration (Team Chat)
As the session progresses, agents communicate through a structured event bus. They debate diagnostic criteria, flag safety concerns, and refine clinical entities autonomously.

## 📊 Operational Profile (Brain View)
Double-clicking any agent reveals their "Brain View"—a holographic interface showing their underlying logic (agent manifest), operational metrics, and specific clinical focus.
