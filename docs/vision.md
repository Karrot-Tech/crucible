# Crucible: Agentic Psychiatric Scribe

## Vision
To create the world's most advanced, safe, and collaborative AI scribe for psychiatry. Crucible moves beyond simple transcription to become an intelligent clinical partner that actively ensures safety, accuracy, and completeness in psychiatric documentation.

## Core Philosophy
1.  **Safety First**: Real-time detection of suicide/homicide risk and abuse is the highest priority.
2.  **Agentic Specialization**: Instead of one general model, use specialized agents (Diagnosis, MSE, Risk) for expert-level performance in each domain.
3.  **Human-in-the-Loop**: The system is designed to collaborate with the psychiatrist, not replace them. It pauses for review at critical decision points.
4.  **Transparent Reasoning**: Every AI decision (diagnosis, code selection) provides evidence and confidence scores.

## Key Capabilities
- **Multi-Agent Architecture**: Orchestrated workflow of specialized agents (Safety, Clinical Entity, Diagnosis, MSE, Risk, Coding, Treatment).
- **Interactive Workspace**: A three-panel UI (Transcript, Agent Workflow, Notes) that visualizes the AI's "thought process".
- **Structured Clinical Data**: automatic mapping to ICD-10-CM F codes, CPT codes, and standard assessment scales (PHQ-9, C-SSRS).
- **Compliance**: Built for HIPAA compliance with "Break the Glass" privacy features and 42 CFR Part 2 consideration.
